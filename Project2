Task: Summarizing an Article
Article:
"Deforestation is accelerating biodiversity loss worldwide. Large-scale tree removal for agriculture, urban development, and logging has destroyed critical habitats for many species. Scientists estimate that if deforestation continues at its current pace, millions of species could face extinction in the coming decades. Conservation efforts, such as reforestation programs and stricter land-use regulations, are being implemented to combat the crisis. However, experts warn that without urgent global action, the effects of deforestation may become irreversible."

Prompt 1: General Summary
Prompt: "Summarize this article."

Output:
"Deforestation is leading to severe biodiversity loss as habitats are destroyed. Conservation measures like reforestation are in place, but without urgent action, the crisis could become irreversible."

Prompt 2: Summary with Context
Prompt: "Please summarize the following article in a few sentences. The article discusses the impact of deforestation on global biodiversity."

Output:
"Deforestation is rapidly accelerating biodiversity loss as forests are cleared for agriculture, urbanization, and logging. Scientists warn that if deforestation persists, countless species may face extinction in the coming decades. Conservation efforts such as reforestation and stricter land-use policies aim to mitigate the damage, but without immediate intervention, the crisis could become permanent."

Prompt 3: Highly Structured Summary
Prompt:
"Summarize the following article in exactly 3 sentences. Ensure the summary includes:

The primary cause of biodiversity loss.
The global consequences if the trend continues.
One proposed solution to the problem.
Do not add personal opinions or extra details."
Output:
"Deforestation is the leading cause of biodiversity loss as forests are cleared for agriculture and urban development. If this continues, millions of species could face extinction in the coming decades. One proposed solution is large-scale reforestation and stricter land-use regulations to protect critical habitats."

Comparison of Summaries
Prompt 1 (Generic): Produces a concise summary but lacks specificity. Key points like global consequences and conservation measures are missing.

Prompt 2 (Contextual): More informative, providing causes, effects, and conservation efforts, but does not follow a strict structure.

Prompt 3 (Highly Structured): The most precise summary, ensuring the inclusion of essential details while adhering to a structured three-sentence format.

Refined Prompts for Clarity and Effectiveness
Prompt 1 (General): "Summarize the key points of this article in 2-3 sentences."

Prompt 2 (Contextual): "Summarize the following article in 3-4 sentences, focusing on the main cause of biodiversity loss, its global consequences, and proposed solutions. The article discusses the impact of deforestation on biodiversity."

Prompt 3 (Highly Specific):
"Summarize the following article in exactly 3 sentences. Include:

The primary cause of biodiversity loss.
The expected global impact if deforestation continues.
One proposed solution to mitigate the issue.
Do not exceed 3 sentences or add additional details."
